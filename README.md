There is a DummyGame class with a lot of comments, if you want to add a new game. I hope it's good enough for that!

I learned Android and Java by myself using e-books and browsing Stack Overflow for solutions, so please don't expect too much from my source code :D

It is a very simple game, but customizable and with some neat functions like hints. Here is my Google Play description:
